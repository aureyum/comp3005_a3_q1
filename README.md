For assignment 3 question 1, we are implementing a PostgreSQL database and write an application that connects to this database to perform specific CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Steps:
Open pgAdmin4 and create students database using the code from database_script.
Use provided database script to fill the database with the schema needed for assignment 3.
Download the files above from code and run Main.java in an IDE (e.g intelliJ).
Now you can modify or query the database with CRUD operations.
